Here we will optimize Quantum circuits using <b>PyZX</b> which is a Python tool implementing the theory of ZX-calculus for the creation, visualisation, and automated rewriting of large-scale quantum circuits.
Demo can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC-KVdB8pf0)

For entire walkthrough visit the official repo [here](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx), I would be doing my work on Google Colab and further instructions in the above Jupyter Notebook would follow the same.
